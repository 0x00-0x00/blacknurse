A simple PoC for the [Blacknurse](http://www.blacknurse.dk/) attack.

"Blacknurse is a low bandwidth ICMP attack that is capable of doing
denial of service to well known firewalls".

Blacknurse apparently makes the CPU hot on:
* Cisco ASA 5515, 5525 (default settings)
* SonicWall
* "Some unverified Palo Alto"
* Maybe more

This attack is 20+ years old, but it didn't had a logo.
